What is it?
===========

Speech Hub is a simple and static command line blog engine. It allows you to create posts and publish then through your domain.

What do you mean about 'command line'?
--------------------------------------

On Speech Hub you are able to create posts, publish then, modify, remove, etc. all using just you *nix command line. You don't need to access a web browser to do it. All you need is Speech Hub, a text editor (doesn't matter the flavor), and a tool to publish the content to your server.

And what do you mean about 'static'?
------------------------------------

It is a static tool because all the process are made on your computer, when you create the blog post. Once you did it you are able to just push the content to your static website.

Okay, but what about 'simple'?
------------------------------

If you remember "The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters", the third rule is "Simple is better than complex". We assume here that if you need a static way to create a blog it may be because Wordpress or Blogspot just became too much complex (or complicated) for your purpose. Several times all you need is a easy, quickly and simple way to publish your content through the web. So, why should I use Wordpress to do it?

Very interesting, but there are several grammar mistakes on your text!

Okay, this is how the things work here: I help you with the blog issues and you help me with English, okay? (free French and Dutch lessons also appreciated)
